# TFT_WeatherClient
This repository contains python code for a Raspberry Pi to allow access to a home weather station
and display the results on a 3.5 inch ELEGOO TFT display.

The file that is center to this project is hwthr.py. The goal is to use this file to display the weather
comming from the Home weather station. The file should launch itself during a boot up so that the weather is showing on the TFT.
